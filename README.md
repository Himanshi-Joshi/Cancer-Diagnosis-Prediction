# Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction

Our topic is cancer diagnosis prediction. We will be discussing in detail about the accuracy of the models used. The dataset is taken from kaggle and has the features of the nucleus along with diagnosis. We have used three models: Logistic regression, Decision tree and Random forest The cross validation technique we have used is K fold. For our project, ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension.
